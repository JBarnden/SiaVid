my son and the iPhone were born three
00:15
weeks apart in June 2007 so while those
00:20
early adopters were lined up outside we
00:22
didn't get their hands on this amazing
00:24
new gadget I was stuck at home with my
00:27
hands full of something else that was
00:29
sending out constant notifications a
00:33
miserable colicky baby who would only
00:37
sleep in a moving stroller with complete
00:40
silence I literally was walking 10 to 15
00:44
miles a day and the baby weight came off
00:46
that part was great but man was I bored
00:50
before motherhood I have been a
00:52
journalist who rushed off when the
00:54
Concorde crashed I was one of the first
00:56
people into Belgrade when there was a
00:58
revolution in Serbia
01:00
now I was exhausted this walking went on
01:05
for weeks it was only until about three
01:08
months in that something shifted though
01:11
as I pounded the pavement my mind
01:15
started to wander too and I began
01:18
imagining what I would do when I finally
01:20
did sleep again
01:21
so the colic did fade and I finally got
01:25
an iPhone and I put all those hours of
01:28
wandering into action
01:29
I created my dream job hosting a public
01:32
radio show so there was no more rushing
01:34
off to war zones but thanks to my new
01:36
smartphone I could be a mother and a
01:39
journalist I could be on the playground
01:41
and on Twitter at the same time yeah
01:45
well when I thought that when the
01:47
technology came in and took over that is
01:49
when I hit a wall so I want you to
01:53
picture this you host a podcast and you
01:55
have to prove that the investment of
01:57
precious public radio dollars in you is
01:59
worth it my goal was to increase my
02:03
audience size tenfold so one day I sat
02:06
down to brainstorm as you do and I came
02:09
up barren and this was different than
02:12
writer's block right it wasn't like the
02:13
something they are waiting to be
02:15
unearthed there was just nothing and so
02:18
I started to think back like one of the
02:20
last time I actually had a good idea
02:21
yeah it was when I was pushing that damn
02:24
stroller now all the cracks in my day
02:27
were filled with phone time I checked the
02:30
headlines while I waited for my latte I
02:32
updated my calendar while I was sitting
02:35
on the couch
02:37
texting turned every spare moment into a
02:39
chance to show my co-workers and my dear
02:42
husband what a responsive person I was
02:44
or at least it was a chance to find
02:46
another perfect couch for my page on
02:48
Pinterest I realized that I was never
02:52
bored and anyway don't only boring
02:54
people get bored but then I started to
02:57
wonder what actually happens to us when
02:59
we get bored or more importantly what
03:02
happens to us if we never get bored and
03:04
what could happen if we got rid of this
03:07
human emotion entirely I started talking
03:10
to neuroscientists and cognitive
03:13
psychologists and what they told me was
03:15
fascinating it turns out that when you
03:15
get bored you ignite a network in
03:20
your brain called the default mode so
03:23
our body it goes on autopilot while
03:26
we're folding the laundry or we're
03:28
walking to work but actually that is
03:29
when our brain gets really busy
03:32
here's boredom researcher dr. sandy man
03:35
once you start daydreaming and allow
03:38
your mind to really wander
03:40
thinking a little bit beyond the
03:42
conscious a little bit into the
03:43
subconcious which allows sort of different
03:45
connections to take place it's really
03:48
awesome actually totally awesome right so
03:51
this is my brain and an fMRI and I
03:54
learned that in the default mode that is
03:56
when we connect disparate ideas we solve
03:58
some of our most nagging problems and we
04:01
do something called autobiographical
04:03
planning this is when we look back at
04:04
our lives we take note of the big
04:06
moments we create a personal narrative
04:08
and then we set goals and we figure out
04:10
what steps we need to take to reach them
04:12
but now we chill out on the couch
04:16
also while updating a Google Doc or
04:18
replying to email we call it getting
04:21
shit done but here's what neuroscientist
04:23
dr. Daniel Levitin says we're actually
04:25
doing
04:27
every time you shift your attention from
04:30
one thing to another the brain has to
04:32
engage a neurochemical switch that uses
04:35
up nutrients in the brain to accomplish
04:37
that so if you're attempting to
04:38
multitask you know doing four or five
04:41
things at once you're not actually doing
04:43
four or five things at once because the
04:45
brain doesn't work that way instead
04:47
you're rapidly shifting from one thing
04:48
to the next depleting neural resources
04:51
as you go so switch switch switch you're
04:53
using glucose glucose glucose exactly
04:55
right and we have a limited supply of
04:57
that stuff so a decade ago we shifted
05:00
our attention at work every three
